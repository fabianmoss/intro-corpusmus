# Introduction to Computational Musicology

## 0 Background

- Computational Musicology
- Software
- Programming skills
- Musicological knowledge 

##1 Representations

### 1.1 Basic elements of Western music

Tones, notes, pitch classes, set theory, intervals scales, etc

- Note names: Regular expressions
- regular automata
- representations of harmonies / chords
  - Roman Numerals (ABC, RomanText, harmalysis, **harm)
  - Pop notation (Harte, lead sheets)
- transducers between representations

### 1.2 Representations of musical pieces

MusicXML, MIDI, MEI, humdrum **kern

Notation Software: Sibelius, Finale, MuseScore

##2  Sequences

### 2.1 Melody

- melodies: n-grams / markov-models / skip grams

### 2.2 Harmony

- HMMs (functional symbols, abstraction)

## 3 Large-scale structure

### 3.1 Harmonic trees

parsing?

### 3.2 Form

Choro / Jazz lead sheets

## 4 Style Analysis

- hierarchical clustering
- classification
- attribution
- dimensionality reduction
- topic modeling 
  - text (writings, books, letters)
  - notes (tpc corpus)
- performance data (look up datasets, spotify APIs)
