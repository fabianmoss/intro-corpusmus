About this course
-----------------

Programing introductions often boring.
A lot of time lost in introducing basic concepts and techniques (important!)
but quite remote from actual (!) applications. Examples are usually "toy examples" 
that work well, but the transition to real-world applications is difficult. 
Of course, the example studies discussed in this course work well, too.
However, they are without exception taken from peer-reviewed, published, open access articles.
They thus reflect actual, recent research questions that reflect current research. 


This course takes thus the opposite approach to "toy examples". We will not introduce many specific 
programing concepts. The course rather showcases what is possible with musical corpus studies. 
If this sparks your interest, it will be much easier to pick up the basics for yourself,
knowing what they are *for* and being motivated intrinsically. 
If you are not particularly interested in doing this kind of work yourself, 
you will still see a broad range of applications that are much more useful to you than 
learning (or not learning) Python basics.

Credits
-------

Active participation in this course is compensated with 3 credit points (CPs), 
`equivalent to a work load of 90 hours <https://verwaltung.uni-koeln.de/abteilung21/content/studienangebot/studiengaenge_u__abschluesse/bachelor__und_masterstudiengaenge/index_ger.html>`_.
These are distributed as follows: 24 SWS (90 minutes) are allocated to presence in the block seminar.
Additionally, 36 SWS are dedicated to the preparation and follow-up of the material. 
The remainder of 30 SWS goes to the reading of the relevant literature.
  
Deliverables and learning objectives 
------------------------------------

Course work consists of three parts: preparing the relevant literature (reading), 
completing the relevant exercises (group work), and critically engaging with the course materials
in the form of a report written together with your group.

- work load management
- organization

.. rubric:: Reading

For each session, the relevant literature is cited in the text. 
Careful preparation is required in order to be able to follow the content of the course.
Because the course will mainly talk about methods and general points of musical corpus research,
the content (and musical topic) will mainly be introduced by the literature. 

I am aware that the reading workload is relatively high since the course will be taught as a block seminar
and doesn't spread out over the entire semester. I hope that the fact that the course is finished before the 
end of the year compensates for this.

- critical reading of scientific literature 

.. rubric:: Group work

At the beginning of the course, you will be randomly assigned to a group. 
Together with your group, you will work on a number of exercises during the course, 
e.g. in Zoom breakout rooms. 

- content of the course units
- specific musicological and/or methodological questions

.. rubric:: Review

After the course has ended, your group will be randomly assigned a course topic. 
It is your task to write a review/report on this topic. 
What did you learn? Which concepts are not clear? Which methods did you (not) understand? 
What is missing? How can the textual descriptions be improved? Who in your group did what? 
Write about the organization of your group, challenges and benefits. 

- create issues on GitHub
- writing academic reviews

.. rubric:: Recommended structure for report

#. **Introduction:** general description and summary of the course and your session in particular. 
#. **Author contributions:** describe briefly how each of you specifically contributed to the report.

.. important::
   Submit your report by **31 January 2021, 23:59h** to `fabian.moss@epfl.ch <mailto:fabian.moss@epfl.ch>`_ 
   as a single PDF file per group, named `intro_corpusmus_<group_number>.pdf`, e.g. `intro_corpusmus_1.pdf`.
