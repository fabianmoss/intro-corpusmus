# Welcome {.unnumbered}

These pages collect the materials for the course _Musikalische Korpusforschung_, taught in the spring term of 2023 at the Institut für Musikforschung at Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg.

The course takes place on Wednesdays from 8 to 10 a.m. in room 107 (CIP Pool, Domerschulstr. 13). The materials will be updated weekly after the course.

## Syllabus {.unnumbered}

This course introduces students to the research area of musical corpus studies, which involves the analysis of large collections of musical data to gain new insights into the structure and style of music. Over the course of 14 weeks, students will learn about various techniques for collecting and processing musical data, including audio feature extraction, transcription, and musical annotation. They will also learn about different approaches to analyzing musical data, including machine learning, statistical modeling, and network analysis. The course will cover practical applications of these techniques, including the study of musical genre, style, and expression, as well as the use of musical corpora in musicology, music education, and music technology. Throughout the course, students will work on hands-on projects to apply what they have learned and to gain a deeper understanding of the field. This course is designed for students with a background in music, computer science, or related fields, who are interested in exploring the exciting and rapidly-growing field of musical corpus studies.

Classes will generally be structured as follows:

* Lecture (~30 min.)
* Q&A and discussion of reading material (~30 min.)
* Group work (~30 min.)
