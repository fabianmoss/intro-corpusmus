# Metadata and data collection

## Dataset collections

::: {.callout-tip}

From the following two overview sites of music datasets, 
try to get an overview of what is listed. Try to find good
descriptors for the different entries.

- [ISMIR datasets](https://www.ismir.net/resources/datasets/)
- [Musical Corpora Register](https://github.com/dharasim/MCR/wiki)

After you have a good overview, choose one or two items
and have a closer look at them. Collaborate with a colleague
on a more detailed description of the dataset, what it contains,
and its potential usage in music research.

## Metadata

:::{.callout-tip}

The [RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales](https://rism.online/)
is probably the largest music database worldwide. 
Perform a couple of queries on their interface, note down what you can find 
out about pieces, which information is contained in the database, 
what other information you would be interested in, and how you would use it 
to do a corpus study.
