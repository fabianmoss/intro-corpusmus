Focus of this course
....................

Programing introductions often boring.
A lot of time lost in introducing basic concepts and techniques (important!)
but quite remote from actual (!) applications. Examples are usually "toy examples" 
and the transition to real-world applications is difficult. 

This course takes the opposite approach. We will not introduce many specific 
programing concepts. The course rather showcases what is possible with musical corpus studies. 
If this sparks your interest, it will be much easier to pick up the basics for yourself,
knowing what they are *for* and being motivated intrinsically. 
If you are not particularly interested in doing this kind of work yourself, 
you will still see a broad range of applications that are much more useful to you than 
learning (or not learning) Python basics.
