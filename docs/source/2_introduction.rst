Focus of this course
....................

Programing introductions often boring.
A lot of time lost in introducing basic concepts and techniques (important!)
but quite remote from actual (!) applications. Examples are usually "toy examples" 
that work well, but the transition to real-world applications is difficult. 
Of course, the example studies discussed in this course work well, too.
However, they are without exception taken from peer-reviewed, published, open access articles.
They thus reflect actual, recent research questions that reflect current research. 


This course takes thus the opposite approach to "toy examples". We will not introduce many specific 
programing concepts. The course rather showcases what is possible with musical corpus studies. 
If this sparks your interest, it will be much easier to pick up the basics for yourself,
knowing what they are *for* and being motivated intrinsically. 
If you are not particularly interested in doing this kind of work yourself, 
you will still see a broad range of applications that are much more useful to you than 
learning (or not learning) Python basics.
