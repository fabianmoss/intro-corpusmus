In the last two decades *Musical Corpus Studies* evolved from a niche discipline into a veritable research area.
The growing availability of digital and digitized musical data as well as the application and development of modern 
methodologies from computer science, machine learning, and data science cast new light on old musicological questions 
and generate entirely novel approaches to empirical music research. 

Moreover, the general methodological and epistemological approach of Musical Corpus Studies allows to transcend traditional
intra-musicological boundaries between its sub-disciplintes (historical/systematic/ethnological/...) without sacrificing the 
respective specific viewpoints and perspectives.

This course offers a fundamental and practical introduction into these topics. 
It demonstrates, explores, and critically reflects central thematic areas and methods by means of a number of case studies.
In the engagement with these topics the course also introduces elementary methods from natural language and music processing, 
as well as statistics, data analysis and visualization.

The course is aimed at students at the undergraduate level who have little or no empirical background and are curious
about quantitative approaches to musicology.
